1. To get started programming with the Hue Android SDK, download the release.  
2. Then copy the Android/jniLibs folder to <project_root>/app/src/main/jniLibs, the .jar's to <project_root>/app/libs, and reopen your project in Android Studio.

- project root
   |- app
       |- libs
       |   |- huecppsdk-wrapper-javadoc.jar
       |   \- huecppsdk-wrapper.jar
       |- src
           |- main
               |- jniLibs
                   |- arm64-v8a
                   |   \- libhuesdk.so
                   |- armeabi
                   |   \- libhuesdk.so
                   \- ...

3. Load the huesdk library in your main activity class:

public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

    static {
        System.loadLibrary("huesdk");
    }

    ...
}

You'll also need the INTERNET permission in your app's manifest in order to communicate with the Hue bridge.

Follow the Java API Guide which explains the general principles and contains Java code examples.

JavaDocs

To load the javadoc in Android Studio, edit <project root>/.idea/libraries/huecppsdk_wrapper.xml and replace <JAVADOC /> with:

    <JAVADOC>
      <root url="jar://$PROJECT_DIR$/app/libs/huecppsdk-wrapper-javadoc.jar!/" />
    </JAVADOC>
